I wanted a way to easily search and see how different emoji will look depending on the device/service so I created this small app using [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org).

The data is scraped from the official [Unicode Full Emoji Data Chart](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html) into a JSON file that is parsed to show the emoji in the app.

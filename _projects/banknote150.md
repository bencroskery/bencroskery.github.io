Website to show off the Canada 150 Commemorative $10 Banknote.

Worked on a small team of developers to design and create a cohesive story to present the many features of the new banknote. I built the 360 note simulation using WebGL with [three.js](https://threejs.org/), and created the signatures hidden behind the portraits using SVG. The advanced graphics will work on any modern browser and will safely fall back to flat images on older browsers to display the content correctly.

I also had a hand in updating the [polymer pages](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/banknotes/bank-note-series/frontiers/), working on the carousel and building the spinny.js library for banknote spinners on the child pages.

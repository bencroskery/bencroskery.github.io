A [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) plugin being developed at Carleton University by the [NMAI Laboratory](http://carleton.ca/nmai/), I am the lead developer on the project at the moment.

The SocialWiki is a wiki with social features built in. The page layout is similar to a typical wiki although page versions are liked or favourited to provide the best page version for the user to look at based on popularity or who they follow.

The plugin is currently integrated into cuLearn *(Carleton eLearning website)* as an experimental plugin and is being tested by multiple professors in their courses primarily as a note taking aggregator.
